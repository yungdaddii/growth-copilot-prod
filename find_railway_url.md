# How to Find Your Railway Backend URL

## Steps:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - https://railway.app
   - Sign in

2. **Find Your Backend Service**
   - Click on your project
   - You should see multiple services (backend, maybe redis, etc.)
   - Click on the **backend** service (not Postgres/database)

3. **Look for the Public URL**
   - In the service view, look for:
     - "Deployment URL" 
     - "Public Networking"
     - "Domains"
     - Or a URL that looks like: `https://xxxxx.up.railway.app`

4. **If No Public URL Exists**
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Look for "Public Networking" or "Domains"
   - Click "Generate Domain" or "Add Domain"
   - Railway will create a URL like: `https://your-app-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

## Once You Have the URL:

Tell me what it is, and I'll:
1. Test the WebSocket connection
2. Verify the database migration worked
3. Update your frontend environment variables

## Important Notes:

- The URL should start with `https://` (not http)
- It should end with `.up.railway.app` or `.railway.app`
- Make sure it's the BACKEND service, not the database
- The backend service is the one showing "Uvicorn running on port 8080" in logs
